# good-first-issue | | Star this repo and share with your friends

Hello, I'm Shanit,

This repo is for any unique coding style, that you have come up with. 
We always copy from somewhere when we are starting our coding journey. I wanna see your twist on that copy. Anything that makes your code different from the rest.

I'm accepting Javascript code mainly. You can submit any frontend as well as backend code (vanilla js, Reactjs, React Native, Nextjs, Nodejs etc.)
Note: Different CSS styles are also accepted.

Explain in the comments the USP (unique selling point) of your code.
